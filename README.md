# ADPCM_G.271
For 'Multimedia Communication' class homework. In this repo, we give a demo of the ADPCM encoding and decoding protocol under G.271.
Teacher: Xiangning Chen.

This is the homework of Aston Xu (徐智昊 161180160) and was first created on 10/01/2019. Happy China's National Day and the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

We got some help from the book named 《数字语音处理及MATLAB实现》 by Xueying Zhang in terms of some Matlab functions.

For this repo's structure, we put all the executable scripts in folder 'scripts' while folder 'utilities' contains all the functions that needed to realize the ADPCM algorithem. For the input and output file, we stored all of them in folder 'data'.

Note for the input data: we reconmmanded you to transform the wav audio data to txt format in order to reduce errors in file reading process. The output will also be stored in txt format. To translate wav to txt, we can turn to Adobe Audition or 'GoldWave' software for help.

The results displayed is the original wave form and the wave form after we decoding it. 

Thank you for reading this introduction.
